# Blockchain-Based Specialized Medical Waste Tracking

A decentralized platform for end-to-end monitoring, verification, and documentation of medical waste from generation through disposal, ensuring regulatory compliance and environmental protection.

## Overview

This blockchain-based system provides comprehensive tracking of hazardous medical waste throughout its entire lifecycle. By creating an immutable chain of custody record, the platform ensures proper handling and disposal of medical waste while generating verifiable compliance documentation for healthcare facilities, waste management companies, and regulatory authorities.

## Core Components

### Generator Registration Contract

The generator registration contract establishes a verifiable registry of medical waste sources with detailed classification.

- **Facility Onboarding**: Registration of hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and other healthcare providers
- **Waste Classification**: Categorization of waste types (sharps, pathological, pharmaceutical, etc.)
- **Volume Tracking**: Monitoring of waste generation patterns and quantities
- **Staff Authorization**: Management of personnel approved for waste handling
- **Generation Points**: Mapping of specific waste origin points within facilities
- **Regulatory Identifiers**: Storage of official waste generator IDs and permits

### Collection Verification Contract

This contract documents the chain of custody during waste pickup and transport phases.

- **Pickup Documentation**: Records of collection events with timestamps and quantities
- **Handler Verification**: Validation of authorized collection personnel
- **Transport Tracking**: Monitoring of waste movement between facilities
- **Container Management**: Records of packaging, labeling, and container integrity
- **Route Optimization**: Data-driven improvement of collection efficiency
- **Incident Reporting**: Documentation of any spills, exposures, or handling issues
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Verification of appropriate environmental conditions during transport

### Treatment Certification Contract

Validates and documents the proper processing and disposal of medical waste according to regulatory requirements.

- **Method Verification**: Confirmation of appropriate treatment methods for each waste type
- **Process Parameters**: Recording of treatment conditions (temperature, duration, chemical agents)
- **Equipment Certification**: Validation of treatment technology compliance with standards
- **Destruction Confirmation**: Verification of complete waste neutralization or destruction
- **Residual Management**: Tracking of any secondary waste streams
- **Sterilization Validation**: Biological indicator testing results for confirming efficacy
- **Alternative Technologies**: Support for various treatment methodologies (autoclave, incineration, etc.)

### Compliance Reporting Contract

Generates comprehensive documentation for regulatory requirements with automated verification.

- **Report Generation**: Creation of required compliance documentation for authorities
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of waste from generation to final disposal
- **Exception Flagging**: Automatic identification of non-compliant handling incidents
- **Regulatory Updates**: Adaptability to changing compliance requirements
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into waste patterns for process improvement
- **Certificate Issuance**: Generation of official disposal certificates
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculation of environmental impact and compliance rates

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Enterprise-grade blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or Ethereum)
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with waste management business logic
- **Storage**: On-chain for critical tracking data, IPFS for detailed documentation
- **IoT Integration**: Connection with weighing systems, scanners, and treatment equipment
- **Mobile Applications**: Field-friendly tools for waste handlers and transporters
- **Regulatory API**: Integration points for automated reporting to authorities
- **Secure Access**: Role-based permissions with multi-factor authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Appropriate blockchain client (based on platform selection)
- Access to blockchain test network
- Development environment with required dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/medical-waste-blockchain.git
   cd medical-waste-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Compile contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy to network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

## Usage Examples

### For Healthcare Facilities

```javascript
// Register waste generation event
await generatorContract.recordWasteGeneration(
  facilityId,
  wasteType,
  quantity,
  containerId,
  handlingStaffId,
  departmentOrigin
);

// Request waste collection
const collectionRequest = await collectionContract.requestPickup(
  facilityId,
  estimatedVolume,
  wasteTypes,
  preferredTimeWindow,
  specialHandlingNeeds
);
```

### For Waste Collection Companies

```javascript
// Document waste pickup
await collectionContract.recordCollection(
  requestId,
  actualQuantity,
  containerIds,
  collectionTime,
  vehicleId,
  handlerIds
);

// Record transport completion
await collectionContract.completeTransport(
  transportId,
  deliveryFacilityId,
  deliveryTime,
  integrityConfirmation,
  transferDocumentation
);
```

### For Treatment Facilities

```javascript
// Record waste treatment
await treatmentContract.documentTreatment(
  batchId,
  treatmentMethod,
  processParameters,
  startTime,
  completionTime,
  operatorId
);

// Generate disposal certificate
const certificateId = await complianceContract.issueDisposalCertificate(
  treatmentBatchId,
  disposalMethod,
  verificationData,
  regulatoryReferences
);
```

## Benefits
